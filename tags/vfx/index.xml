From the initial snapshot, different channels and values are stored in texture buffers for the simulation to consume and modify.
In the example video below, an outward velocity vector is added so that the displacement is directed toward the edges of the screen.
Various controls are available for the simulation to achieve different results. For example, dissipation per color channel, viscosity, velocity direction, and intensity, among others.</description></item><item><title>Stylized Arcs &amp; Sparkles VFX</title><link>https://swess.github.io/projects/teleportvfx/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swess.github.io/projects/teleportvfx/</guid><description>A VFX shader and particle system for stylized arcs and sparkles made in Unity (URP 12.1.14).
This was made and used in our current project at Canorous Interactive for different contexts and with different variants.
