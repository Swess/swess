The Half-Lambert lighting term is utilized in various commercial games such as Team Fortress 2 and Valorant, and extensively described online. I won&amp;rsquo;t delve into the technical details and differences between the various lighting techniques, but here are some link for quick explanations and examples.</description></item><item><title>ScreenSpace Simulation</title><link>https://swess.github.io/projects/screenspace-simulation-vfx/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swess.github.io/projects/screenspace-simulation-vfx/</guid><description>This is a 2D simulation VFX driven by the pixel channels&amp;rsquo; values. From the initial snapshot, different channels and values are stored in texture buffers for the simulation to consume and modify.
In the example video below, an outward velocity vector is added so that the displacement is directed toward the edges of the screen.
Various controls are available for the simulation to achieve different results. For example, dissipation per color channel, viscosity, velocity direction, and intensity, among others.</description></item><item><title>Stylized Fog Shader</title><link>https://swess.github.io/projects/fogshader/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swess.github.io/projects/fogshader/</guid><description>Stylized fog shader made in Unity (URP 12.1.14). This shader was made and used in our current project at Canorous Interactive for different contexts.
Controls over textures, colors, and different parameters renders it very flexible and allow for a very wide range of stylization and usecases.

The theme of the GGJ 2019 was: What home means to you
The prototype has been developed with a small team of 6 persons, including 2 programmers, 1 game designer &amp;amp; 3 artists. Our team, called JAMKIS, was part of the second season of JamNation.
The game brings you in an ancestral adventure where you play the role of an Inuit tasked to finish the construction of your igloo on time while maintaining your family alive and warm.</description></item><item><title>Safeguard the realm</title><link>https://swess.github.io/projects/safeguardtherealm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swess.github.io/projects/safeguardtherealm/</guid><description>A tower defense concept combined with an auto-battler in-game progression inspiration.
