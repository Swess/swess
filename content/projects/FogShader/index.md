Stylized fog shader made in Unity (URP 12.1.14).
This shader was made and used in our current project at [Canorous Interactive](https://www.canorousinteractive.com/) for different contexts.

Controls over textures, colors, and different parameters renders it very flexible and allow for a very wide range of stylization and usecases.
