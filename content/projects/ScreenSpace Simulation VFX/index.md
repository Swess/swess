This is a 2D simulation VFX driven by the pixel channels' values. From the initial snapshot, different channels and values are stored in texture buffers for the simulation to consume and modify.

In the example video below, an outward velocity vector is added so that the displacement is directed toward the edges of the screen.

Various controls are available for the simulation to achieve different results. For example, dissipation per color channel, viscosity, velocity direction, and intensity, among others.
